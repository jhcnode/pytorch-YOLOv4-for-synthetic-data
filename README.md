# pytorch-YOLOv4-for-synthetic-data
YOLOv4 training using synthetic data(combine objects with background)

1. training yolov4 for synthetic data
2. generate anchor(object image only)

# train

train.py

# To do 

1. Half Prescision Inference(C++,Cuda)
2. Half2 Prescision Inference(C++,Cuda)
3. Weights Converting(Darket <-> PyTorch)
4. Release weights that training public data
