# pytorch-YOLOv4-for-synthetic-data
YOLOv4 training on synthetic data(combine objects with background)

1. training yolov4 for synthetic data
2. generate anchor(object image only)

# train


# To do 

1. Half Prescision Inference
2. Half2 Prescision Inference
3. Weights Converting(Darket <-> PyTorch)
4. Release weights that training public data
